# foodforthepeople
A repository of tasty, simple, and mostly inexpensive recipes. Cooking for all!

### Food
We all love food... we'll I do, and luckily for you I also like to share recipes.

### Cooking ~ Science ~ Coding
Cooking, like science and coding involves several iterations, failed experiments, and "this could be improved". So this is the place will I will put mine modifications to recipes, so that other can use. This being GitHub, it also means that others can see what went wrong, that the recipe, and improve it. 


### Authors and Contributors
It will be mostly done by me, @adomingues, with the help of my partner in crime, AF, which does not have a GitHub account. Yet.

### Contact
Tips, hints, and cookies to my [inbox](amjdomingues@gmail.com).
