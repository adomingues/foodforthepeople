This is site was created with the intention of keeping track of recipes I try and use on a regular basis. This way can add notes on what failed, if I liked them or not, and how it was modified to accommodate for missing ingredients.

### Why Online?

* Easier to share with friends and family.
* Can look up recipes when grocery shopping.
* Ego. 

### The name and "philosophy"

I often seen food blogs supposedly done by every day working people but that contain professional grade photos, recipes with 100s of ingredients and not all of them readily  available or useful for other recipes. The goal here is to keep it simple and down to earth. I like to cook and to eat good food, I don't have much time or too much money to spend on meals. Also I am stingy. I am a member of the People.

The food revolution has begun!
