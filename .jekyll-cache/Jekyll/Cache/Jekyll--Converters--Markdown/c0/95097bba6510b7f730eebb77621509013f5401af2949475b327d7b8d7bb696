I"ž<p>I had some friends over and decided to make some nice and different. Also something that could be prepared in advance and be hot and ready for them. A stew (or slow cooked dish) is always a good choice especially now that the cold weather is upon us. To make it a little different, I went with lambâ€¦ who am I kidding? Lamb is one of my favorite meats and I use any excuse to eat it. The Uzbek spice mix is also something quite different but not too different that would raise high brows from more nit-picky guests.</p>

<p>As a side, the cauliflower mash brings itâ€™s own flavor to the table, without overpowering the main course. This mash is fast becoming one of my favorite side dishes for its ease of preparation, and tasteâ€¦ and it takes no time to prepare!</p>

<p>In end the guests were quite happy - the wine might have had something to do with it - and ate everything. I call it a success, my mom would say I should have made more food and the guest left the house hungry.</p>

<p>There is no picture of the food, but I have one of the classic Portuguese roasting pot used to prepare it. Made of clay it is excellent to make one pot dishes in the oven.</p>

<h4 id="variations">Variations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Beef can be used instead of the lamb. I did it with a cheap cut, and must that due to nature of meat - lamb doesnâ€™t need to cooked for a long time and beef sometimes gets better with longer cooking times - beef can be even better.</li>
  <li>I sometimes add carrots cut in chunks to the stew to have extra portion of veggies. Add the carrots to pot about 1 hour before it finishes cooking to have them crunchy, or from the beginning if you prefer them soft.</li>
  <li>[vegetarian] I have not tried it, but this spice mix could be a good basis for a vegetarian curry/stew.</li>
  <li>Use a Crockpot (slow cooker), or simmer it in a stove.</li>
  <li>Use double the amount of red wine (old open bottle) instead of the red wine vinegar. Trick learned from poorer times.</li>
  <li>Increase the amount of cayenne pepper for extra punch.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h4>

<p>Originally I saw the sauce in <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Webers-Grillbibel-GU-Weber-Grillen/dp/3833818638/">Weberâ€™s Grill Bibel</a> and it was to marinate lamb chops. During a botched BBQ party - it rained - I had the sauce prepared and the only way to use it was a stew with beef. It worked. From the original I doubled the amounts of Thyme and Cumin.</p>

<h4 id="directions">Directions</h4>

<p><em>Cauliflower mash</em></p>

  <li>Drain the cauliflower very well, and in bowl (or pot) add the other ingredients. PurÃ© with a blender until smooth. Add some more salt if needed.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Lamb stew</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-heat the oven at 180Âºc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prepare the sauce, blend all the ingredient - except the lamb - with a blender.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>De-bone the meat, and cut it in 1-2 cm thick chunks, put in a stove-proof pot (with a lid!), mix the sauce, cover the pot, and stick it in the oven.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook for about 30 minutes, and then lower the temperature to 150Âºc. Cook for another 3-3 and half hours. Serve in a rustic pot with the side of Cauliflower mash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sauce, pour off excess fat from the frying pan and place over a high heat. Pour in the port, stirring to deglaze, and let bubble for a minute. Add the cranberry jam and reduce the heat. Mix the cornflour with a splash of cold water to dissolve, and add it to the pan mixing well. Let it bubble until the liquid has the desired consistency. If it gets too thick, add a splash of water and mix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add any juices from the resting duck. Taste and adjust the seasoning and add some jam or orange juice if desired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Slice the duck breasts on the diagonal and fan them out on warmed serving plates. Spoon the sauce around the duck and serve with the mashed celery root.</p>
