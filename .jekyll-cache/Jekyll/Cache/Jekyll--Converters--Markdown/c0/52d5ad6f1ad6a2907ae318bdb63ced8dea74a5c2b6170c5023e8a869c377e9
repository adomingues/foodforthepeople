I"`<p>The Linguist also likes to cook and try new recipes. She also happens to read a newspaper, SZ to those in the know, that publishes some nice recipes in the weekend edition. Those tend to look nice, but also be on the elaborate side of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt bother to buy all the ingredients‚Äù. This one however is just about easy enough to prepare and doesn‚Äôt require extravagant ingredients, so we decided to give a go.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/img/PumpkinAndGoatCheesePie.jpg" alt="Burn!" /></p>

<p>And it turned out quite nicely. Ok, the pumpkin was a little dark, but I don‚Äôt mind and it was very tasty. Will do again.</p>

<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The original recipe had only 100 g of cream cheese. The package we bought had 150 g. We used it all and will not apologize for it.</li>
  <li>Choose a relatively strong goat cream cheese, otherwise it will be hard for the flavor to come through.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Flour type 550: 200 g</li>
  <li>Butter: 100 g, cold</li>
  <li>Cold water: 60 g, cold</li>
  <li>Vinegar: 1 tablespoon</li>
  <li>Red Curi squash/Hokkaido: small one (~500 g), sliced</li>
  <li>Olive oil: 2 tablespoon</li>
  <li>Honey: 2 tablespoon</li>
  <li>Thyme: 4 sprigs</li>
  <li>Goat cream cheese: 150 g</li>
  <li>Eggs: 3</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper: to taste</li>
  <li>Cayenne peper: a pinch</li>
  <li>Pistachios unsalted: 20 g; roughly chopped.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="directions">Directions</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mix the flour with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and add flakes of butter. Finely crumble with the fingers until no coarse pieces of butter are left and the flour is still granular. Add the vinegar and the water, mix with a tablespoon, and knead with the hands until the dough is smooth (The Linguist cheated and used the <a href="http://www.bosch-home.co.uk/products/food-preparation/accessories-for-kitchen-machines.html">MUM</a>). Shape it into a ball, and let it sit for 30-60 minutes in the fridge (you can wrap it in aluminum foil).</li>
  <li>Pre-heat the oven at 200¬∫c. Quarter the Hokkaido and de-seed. Cut it in thin slices.</li>
  <li>In a bowl mix olive oil, honey, salt and pepper. Throw in pumkin slice to coat with this marinade.</li>
  <li>Lay the pumpkin slices in a baking tray covered with baking paper and roast for 20 minutes. Let it cool in the tray. Reduce the oven temperature to 180¬∞c.</li>
  <li>Coat a 23 cm pie form with butter and spread the dough. The Linguist puts the dough in the form and squashes it into shape with her hands and the bottom of a glass. Cover with baking paper and spread dried pods or dummy balls on top to prevent the dough from rising - we actually used lentils, but dried beans or chickpeas will also work. Pre-bake the dough for 15 minutes (middle shelf), remove the lentils (or whatever) and the baking paper and bake for another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Pick the Thyme leaves and chop them in very small pieces. Mix the eggs with cream cheese until it is an homogeneous cream. Add the thyme, salt, black and cayenne pepper. Pour the mixture in the pre-backed dough, spread the pumpkin on top and sprinkle the pistachio. Bake at 160¬∞c for about 20 minutes, or until the filling is set and slightly brown.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
