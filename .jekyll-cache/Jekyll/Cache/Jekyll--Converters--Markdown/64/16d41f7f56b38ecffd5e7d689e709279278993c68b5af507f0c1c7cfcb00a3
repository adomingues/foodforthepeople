I"7<p>When the sun starts setting early, the body starts aching for some more substantial food, and salads no long have an appeal. it is time for an earthy dish, with one of the most nutritious, flavorsome, and yet vilified, organ meats: liver. It is also a very cheap meat that and cooks extremely fast. To add to the Autumnal feel of this dish, there is also cabbage and parsnip. All in all a very healthy and flavorsome dish.</p>

<h4 id="variations">Variations</h4>

<p>Instead of the hearts and liver, you can use just one of those, or replace them with giblets. Additionally, spicy it up with more piri-piri and serve it as a snack with a beer (or two) and friends. This variation is very popular in Portugal.</p>

<p>The parsnip fries will go well with other dishes, specially roasts. You can also experiment with other spices or herbs, for instance Rosemary, instead of the paprika.</p>

<p>And how to pick the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo">Chouriço</a> you ask? Actually, for this dish the <em>best</em> chouriço is not what you are looking for. The best one is mostly meat, and very little fat, which excellent as a <em>petisco</em> (appetizer or <em>Tapas</em>). For this dish however, you want one with fast which will release the nice spices into the sauce. We call it “Chouriço corrente”.</p>

<p>For the stew the starting point was a classical <a href="http://www.saborintenso.com/f21/petisco-moelas-323/">Portuguese giblets snack</a> which I replaced with liver and hearths because my SO is not fond of giblets. The cabbage was a serendipitous experiment one day that there was some left over in the fridge.</p>

<p>There are plenty of parsnip fries in the interwebs, but <a href="http://ahouseinthehills.com/2014/02/04/paprika-parsnip-fries/">this</a> is one of the simplest ones. My version is pretty much the same - without the extra sauce - and adjusted for my oven.</p>

<h4 id="directions">Directions</h4>

</ol>

<p><em>Red Curi Squash mash</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Thaw the the liver and hearts, wash with cold water, remove extra fat, dry with kitchen paper and cut the livers in half.</li>
  <li>In a pot, fry the livers in butter for about 5 minutes in medium heat until they are half-done. They will finish cooking later in the stew. Removed them from the pot and set aside.</li>
  <li>If needed add some more butter to the pan, and gently fry onion and garlic. Also add the bay leaves.</li>
  <li>After about 5 minutes, or when the onion is translucent, add the chouriço frying it for a little bit to release some of the spices and fat, and then hearts mixing it all together. Add some salt and the chilies/piri-piri, cover the pot and fry for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Throw in the tomato paste, wine and water, mix it all up, cook for another 10 minutes and then add the cabbage. In the closed pot the cabbage will wilt during the cooking. Let it cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
