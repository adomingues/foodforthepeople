I"›	<p>Salad is a staple for those warm summer nights. Mots of the time, we stick to leafy green salads, but once in a while is good to have something different, specially something with fish. While in Portugal I copied a few recipes from magazines lying around my mumâ€™s kitchen, and one of them was for a salad with grilled tuna, avocado and tomatoes. Brilliant.</p>

<p>With the recipe at hand, I went grocery shopping, and when back at home things started going south. Guess what: the avocado was over-ripe - actually black inside - so this had to be excluded. There was no tuna in our freezer but salmon is a good replacement. Also, instead of the coriander from the original recipe, there was some parsley left-over that needed eating. The egg was not in the original recipe, but I find the combination of salmon and egg a very good one. So there. In end it turned to be a very tasty summery salad even though a completely different one from the original.</p>
