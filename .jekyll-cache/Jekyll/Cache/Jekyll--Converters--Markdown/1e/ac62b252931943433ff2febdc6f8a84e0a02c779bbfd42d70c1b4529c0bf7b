<p>I like desserts with coconut or nuts, thus when a colleague told me about this Low-Carb version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffaello_(confection)">Raffaello pralines</a> I just had to try it.</p>

<p>Raffaello are a commercially available sweet that happens to have both coconut and almonds, and but for the excessive sweetness (for my taste anyway) it is quite good actually. The recipe does not quite replicate the sweet - I failed to form proper pralines with the proper shape - but makes a very <em>coconutty</em>, easy to prepare dessert. It is made with pre-packaged ingredients, most of which might already be in oneâ€™s pantry - except maybe for the almond meal or coconut flour - so something to prepare in a hurry when guests come unannounced.</p>

<p>A few notes on the ingredients:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(dairy_product)">quark</a> is an dairy product common in central Europe, and it is very versatile and tasty. It is something between a full fat Yogurt and cottage cheese. I use it very often as dessert with Apple mousse (and cinnamon). If you canâ€™t get your hands to it, use another fresh cheese. Check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(dairy_product)">wiki</a> article for names and alternatives in other languages/countries.</li>
  <li>The almond flour is used to increase the consistency of the mixture and can be replaced by other nut flours or coconut flour.</li>
  <li>Honey can be replaced with plain sugar. I prefer honey.</li>
</ol>

<p>I once mixed it with KitchenAid (step 1) with the whisker adapter thingy and it turned out too liquid. The mixing should be gentle.</p>
