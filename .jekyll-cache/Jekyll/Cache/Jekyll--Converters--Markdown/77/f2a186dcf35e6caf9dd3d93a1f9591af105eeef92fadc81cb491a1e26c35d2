I"<p>Summer is now almost over, but it is still warm enough for salads. And a salad does not need to be a sad affair, even if the ingredients are run of the mill, as I have been discovering. This one has Tuna in it to remind me of the Ocean, which I dearly miss, and tahini (sesame paste) to make me feel fancy. The halloumi is there to bulk it up and make it a proper main dish.</p>

<p>The fancy ingredients, tahini and halloumi, can be found in large supermarkets, health food stores or Turkish/Middle Eastern stores, and they keep for long, specially the tahini, so no need to go every week to a store on the other side of town. The green used for the salad can be whatever you have at hand and can be eaten raw - any variety of lettuce, watercress, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerianella">Valerianella</a>, or a mix of all of these will do. The first time I have seen Valerianella was in Germany, so I am not sure about the availability in other countries.</p>

<p>I noticed that depending on the brand, tahini can be more or less fatty and I was suspicious that some of it might be of lower quality. So, I asked a colleague that has a middle eastern background if there was any way to choose ‚Äúthe best‚Äù tahini and apparently having a layer of fat at the top of the jar is normal and expected. Unless it is too much, let‚Äôs say 1/4 of the volume, it actually indicates a good quality tahini. One thing to bear in mind is one should homogenize the tahini - for instance with a spoon - before taking it from the jar.</p>

<p>As for the halloumi, don‚Äôt fret if you can‚Äôt find ‚Äúreal‚Äù halloumi - any grill cheese with do, and I tend to buy the cheap ones pre-marinated with chili. And if you don‚Äôt have it or are not that hungry, no problem, the salad will work without it as well.</p>

<p>Whilst you could use black pepper to season this dish, I strongly recommend white pepper which goes extremely well with some fish dishes.</p>
