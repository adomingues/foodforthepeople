I"ë<p>What I like about this salad its the freshness that comes from the peaches added to the tanginess of the white wine vinegar. It is also very colorful and a treat to the eyes. Even though it can be eaten by itself in a warm summer evening, it is perfect as a side in a BBQ. Vegetarian friendly, though not in the picture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As per usual, once I messed up the grocery shopping, so instead of the tomatoes I got a cucumber, and instead of the green pepper I got a red. Went ahead and made the salad with these ingredients and it worked. I still prefer the tomatoes for this salad though.</li>
