<p>I must confess: I love cabbage. It goes well with any number of dishes, nutritious, has a wonderful green color, and comes in many variates. I am still skeptikal about green smoothies, and have profound dislike for the current Kale love. My forefathers grew <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repolho">Repolho</a> before any hipster donned its first cap!</p>

<p>Cabbage is a serious matter for me. Anyway, I got hold of this recipe and though it was a interesting combination of salmon and Vegetable king, and the Dill vinagrette intrigued me.</p>

<p>Who am I kidding? I wanted a cabbage dish and there was not a lot of time to prepare it. This fitted the bill. It also turned out to have a wonderful flavor with the dill and lemon combining well with the cabbage.</p>

<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I have a Kumquat tree which happens to have fruits at the moment. I took a Kumquat and squeezed the juice on top of the salmon before sticking it in the oven for extra citrus flavor.</li>
  <li>The recipe states Dijon mustard, and I kept because it sounds fancy. In fact, I used the rest of an old Bautzen mustard jar.</li>
  <li>The original recipe had 2 types of cabbage, Kale and Savoy. The hipsters took all the GrÃ¼hnkohl from the supermaket. No problem. It worked nicely with just the Savoy and it sounds frencher.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Martha Stewart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Low-Diet-Cookbook-Smart-Carb-Recipes/dp/156924359X">book</a> on our shelve for while and even though we made a few recipes, it seems underused. This recipe came from there and it was a hit, so hopefully there will be more to come.</p>
