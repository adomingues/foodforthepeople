<p>We all love food‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll I do, and luckily for you I also like to share recipes.</p>

<h3 id="cooking--science--coding">Cooking ~ Science ~ Coding</h3>
<p>Cooking, like science and coding involves several iterations, failed experiments, and ‚Äúthis could be improved‚Äù. So this is the place where modifications to recipes will be recorded so that our future selfs and others can use them. This being GitHub, it also means that others can see what went wrong and improve on it.</p>

<h3 id="authors-and-contributors">Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>It will be mostly done by me, @adomingues, with the help of my partner in crime, AF, which does not have a GitHub account. Yet.</p>

<p>The recipes are sourced from a few cookbooks, the internet and friends/family. Whenever possible the source will be clearly stated.</p>
