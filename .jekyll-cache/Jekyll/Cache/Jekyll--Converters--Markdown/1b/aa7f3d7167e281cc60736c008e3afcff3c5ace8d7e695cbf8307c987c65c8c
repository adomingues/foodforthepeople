I"<p>This blog has been lacking something. New recipes for one. But also something fancy and something that I have not yet done, but will do this Christmas. So if you prepared it before the 25th you are on your own. Also no picture.</p>

<p>And this recipe? Well, I am big fan of celeriac as a side dish and anything will cheese, namely <em>gratins</em> will make me heart warm. So when I saw the filling for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/12/vegetarian-christmas-lunch-anna-jones-modern-cook">this recipe</a> in The Guardian [of Manchester] I immediately saw an opportunity to impress my in-laws. More on that later.</p>

<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>

<p>From the original recipe a few things were changed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>no crust obviously</li>
  <li>way less honey, 1 tablespoon became 1 teaspoon</li>
  <li>half of the herbs were used, though I probably should have used all of it.</li>
  <li>I forgot to grate 1/3 of the celeriac</li>
  <li>Celeriac was cubbed and fried in 2 tablespoon of olive olive oil for about 10 minutes, instead of boiling. I hoped this would give it a bit more flavor.</li>
  <li>Cheddar was replaced with 100 g Emmentaler and 150 g of Gruy√©re.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="directions">Directions</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Simmer the garlic cloves for 2-3 minutes, then drain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the same pan (dried), fry the garlic in olive oil on a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and 200 ml of water, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the honey, most of the rosemary and thyme (save a little, with the sage) and salt. Cook on medium heat for another 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated. The the garlic cloves should be coated in a dark syrup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the sauce is thickening, peel the celeriac and cut it into quarters, setting aside about 1/3. Slice the rest in 2 cm-thick pieces. Boil these pieces in hot water for 7-10 minutes. Drain. Meantime, grate the remaining celeriac.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In bowl mix the boiled celeriac, cheese, creme fraiche, lemon juice, mustard, parsley and eggs. Add salt and grind of pepper and gently fold in the caramelized garlic cloves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Coat lightly an over form with olive oil, and then add the mix, grated celeriac, rosemary, thyme, all the sage, and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for 45 minutes or until it has set and the top is golden brown.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
