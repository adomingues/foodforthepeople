I"]<p>I am not the biggest fish fan, but sometimes I just feel like having seafood. This is variation of the classic Portuguese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feijoada">Feijoada</a>, which has very little to do with the original. Then again Feijoada means “made from beans”, this dish has beans. The white beans and seafood are very nice combination, and the parsley is staple of Portuguese cuisine. When in doubt, add parsley.</p>

<p>As per usual this recipe can be made with readily available ingredients and is very easy as fast to prepare. It is also quite tasty and nutritious. I sometimes add some Piri-piri or chili to give it a bit more humph, but if the chouriço is spicy it will give enough flavor to the dish.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both the carrots and the peas are not in the original recipe and I use them to bulk up the dish, but one could omit them. I could remove the peas, they don’t add much to the flavor, but I really the carrots in this dish.</li>
  <li>If you feel fancy try some fish stock. The original recipe did not have any stock at all, so it could be omitted. I like to add it for extra flavor.</li>
  <li>Thawing theSeafood in advance is a good idea, but if you don’t, just cook it for another 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of my favorite <a href="http://www.saborintenso.com/f40/feijoada-frutos-do-mar-10464/">sources</a> for Portuguese recipes. There is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/saborintensocom">youtube channel</a> which sometimes help for more elaborate dishes. Portuguese only though.</p>
