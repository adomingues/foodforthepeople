I")	<p>After being served celeriac and apple mash in Restaurants a few times I have been keen to replicate it at home. It is a quite tasty side, slightly on the sweet side, and very easy to prepare. Eventually I saw a recipe in a baby food book - and my bebé needed food - which served as a catalyst. I tried to achieve a recipe that is suitable for babies, about 1 year old, but also for adults.</p>

<p>In the above picture is how it got served for the baby, but for us we used it as a side for <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Pork-fillet-with-orange-and-mustard/">pork fillet</a></p>

<p>I guess one could skip the popatoes. I have it in there to make it more substantial for the Bebé.</p>
