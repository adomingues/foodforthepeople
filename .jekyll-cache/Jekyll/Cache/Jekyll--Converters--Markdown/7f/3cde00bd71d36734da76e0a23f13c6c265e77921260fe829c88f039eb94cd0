<p>This a staple or middle-eastern food but it is far from exotic to prepare. Very flexible it can be eaten as a snack/starter at an house party - also easy to carry - or as a main dish in a light meal. The Hommous can be scooped with some bread, though I prefer the lighter/healthier variant of using some carrot and/or cucumber sticks. I have not tried it myself, but make it smooth, and it can be part of a leafy salad.</p>

<p>Hommous is also one of those dishes that are available pre-prepared in supermarkets, but it takes so little time and effort, that I donâ€™t see why one should not take control of the ingredients that one ingests instetad of byuing something with added (unnecessary) ingredients: all you need are some canned chickpeas, tahini, lemon, garlic and you are set to go. All things that I keep in the pantry for an emergency.</p>

<p>Even though the paprika and parsley are optional, I like the color and flavor that they bring. And this is the basic version. There some more elaborate versions of the dish, but judging from who successful this version has been with friends, I will keep it simple - the People does not over-complicate.</p>

<p>A very good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Low-Diet-Cookbook-Smart-Carb-Recipes/dp/156924359X">book</a> with Low GI recipes: The Low GI Diet Cookbook: 100 Simple, Delicious Smart-Carb Recipes. Though now I tend to go with lower carb recipes, this book still has some pretty good recipes that I find worth revisiting.</p>
