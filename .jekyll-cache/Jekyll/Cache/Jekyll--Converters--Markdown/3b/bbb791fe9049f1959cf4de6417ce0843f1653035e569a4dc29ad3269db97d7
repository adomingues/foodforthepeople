I"‡<p>Frittatas. Omelets for the middle class. What I love about them as that the basic ingredients are usually in the house - eggs - and then one throw what it whatever is lying around the pantry/fridge. It can even be used to re-purpose left-overs. Adding veggies to it also makes it a very nourishing and nutritious meal. It is also easy to put together and is one of my go to recipes when I run out of ideas.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/img/FetaFrittata.jpg" alt="All the eggs!" /></p>

<p>This recipe has Feta and chouriÃ§o, which are two of my favorite ingredients. Both very versatile and full of flavor and thus very little extra seasoning is needed. But donâ€™t be bound to these ingredients. See variations for more ideas.</p>

<p>I happen to be lucky enough to have flameproof roasting tin, which means that I can make the dish in one pot. However, I have previously prepared the frittata in a frying pan, or pot, and after mixing with the egg, transfered everything to a roasting tin and into the oven. No problem. Ah, yes, I have a kitchen aid thingy also know as <a href="http://www.bosch-home.co.uk/products/food-preparation/accessories-for-kitchen-machines.html">MUM</a> which turns the preparation of vegetables in to a childâ€™s play. Before I used a Juliane peeler.</p>

<ul>
  <li>With minced meat, fried with the onion, and chilies</li>
  <li>Pumpkin, Feta and sage.</li>
  <li>Mushrooms. Very careful that it doesnâ€™t get too soggy.</li>
  <li>Butter will also do instead of the olive oil.</li>
  <li>I like to add cream to the adds to bulk it up, but you can leave it out.</li>
