I"ü<p>Cauliflower mash is becoming one of my favorite side dishes. Very easy to prepare and versatile, it goes well with a number of dishes, specially <a href="http://weekendfamily.github.io/foodforthepeople/blog/easy-chicken-stew/">stews</a>. This version is more evolved, with the spring onion and bacon making it almost a main course on itâ€™s own, but remove that and you are left with an incredible, and healthy, complement to most meals.</p>

<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The spring onion and bacon are extras and not needed for the basic mash.</li>
  <li>If you donâ€™t have creme fraiche at hand any heavy cream will do. I have used greek yogurt in a pinch.</li>
  <li>You can also add a dollop of butter.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cauliflower: 2 heads, cut into florets</li>
  <li>Creme fraiche: 150g</li>
  <li>Parmigiano: 50 g, grated</li>
  <li>Garlic: 1 clove, minced</li>
  <li>Spring onion: 1 bunch, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>Bacon cubes: 150 g</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper: to taste</li>
  <li>Nutmeg: to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="directions">Directions</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Boil the cauliflower florets for about 15 minutes or until soft in water with a little salt.</li>
  <li>While the cauliflower cooks, gently fry the bacon in a frying pan at medium heat for about 5 minutes. It should not need any fat other than itâ€™s own. Add the spring onion and fry until cooked (about 5 minutes). Reserve.</li>
  <li>Once the cauliflower is cooked, strain it removing as much water as possible. This is critical as otherwise the mash will be a little runny.</li>
  <li>Add the creme fraiche and cheese, season with salt, pepper and the nutmeg, and blend it all together.</li>
  <li>Serve with a topping of the bacon and spring onion.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
