<p>There are many food blogs which are supposedly done by every day working people but contain professional grade photos, and feature recipes with 100s of ingredients - not all of them readily available or useful for other recipes. This site is the antithesis. The goal here is to keep it simple and down to earth. We enjoying cooking and good food, but we don‚Äôt have much time or money to spend on extravagant meals. Also we are stingy. We are the People and the food revolution has begun!</p>
