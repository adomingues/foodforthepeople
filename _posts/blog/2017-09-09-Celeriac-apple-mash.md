After being served celeriac and apple mash in Restaurants a few times I have been keen to replicate it at home. It is a quite tasty side, slightly on the sweet side, and very easy to prepare. Eventually I saw a recipe in a baby food book - and my bebé needed food - which served as a catalyst. I tried to achieve a recipe that is suitable for babies, about 1 year old, but also for adults.

In the above picture is how it got served for the baby, but for us we used it as a side for [pork fillet]({{ site.url }}/blog/Pork-fillet-with-orange-and-mustard/)


#### Variations

I guess one could skip the popatoes. I have it in there to make it more substantial for the Bebé.

#### Ingredients

* Celeriac: 1, aprox. 500 grams, roughly cubbed in 0.5-1 cm pieces
* Granny smith apples: 2, aprox. 300 grams, quartered
* Potato: 1, roughly cubbed in 1 cm pieces
* Shallot, 1, roughly chopped
* Bay leaves, 1
* Butter, 1 tablespoon
* Cream, 2 tablespoons
* Sea salt: to taste
* Black Pepper: to taste


#### Directions

1. Top the celeriac, peel it with a knife removing the rough bits. Peel the potato and core the apples, and cut everything into cubes (small if they are to prepare baby food). 
2. Heat the butter in medium-high heat on a pot, and cook the onion for a couple of minutes. Add the celeriac, the potatoes and the apple and cook for another 5 minutes with the lid on.
3. Add water up to 3/4 of the vegetables (the apple will cook with the vapor alone), heat until boiling an reduce the heat down to medium. Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender.
4. Once the vegetables are soft, reserve half the liquid to a cup, add salt, pepper and cream, and puree. Add the reserved liquid to achieve the desired consistency.
5. Enjoy.
