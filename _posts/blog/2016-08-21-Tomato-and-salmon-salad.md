This was supposed to have avocado in the salad, and coriander instead of parsley. But guess what, the avocado was over-ripe - actually black inside - and there was some parsley left-over that needed eating. The egg was also not in the original recipe, but I find the combination of salmon and egg a very good one. So there. In end it turned to be a very tasty summery salad.
