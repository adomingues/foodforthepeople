The best thing about my paleo /low carb phase, apart from the weight loss and general well-being, was to discover new ingredients and new ways of cooking that I had no idea existed. One the recipes that stuck and it is a favorite, is this one for banana pancakes using only 2/3 main ingredients. Simple, nutritious and using left-over bananas!

The recipe does have a tricky bit. When frying there a few things to pay attention to:

- Don't use too much batter otherwise it will be difficult to flip the bancakes without breaking them. I fill a small ladle, or about half of a regular one. Try it out on the first batch.
- The frying temperature is a bit of a juggling act. Too hot and it will burn, not hot enough hand it will take too long. I start with medium hight heat, and then lower the temperature a bit if the pan gets too hot.
- Using a spatula lift the side of the bancake a little to determine if it's solid enough before flipping.
- Using a large pan I can fry 3 bancakes in each batch with reduces cooking time.

Serve it with anything you like! Some of our regular combinations:

- soft goat cheese with honey or jam
- peanut butter
- cheese
- Yogurt on top
- Raspberry coulis (pictured)


### Replacements

- Coconut butter instead of normal butter. More expensive but the pancakes will have an ever so slight taste of coconut.
- Almond flower instead of coconut flour will make it fluffier, but I prefer the slightly denser consistency provided by the coconut flour.  Or...
- Don't use any flour


## Tips

- Freeze peeled overripe bananas and use them for this dish. Why waste food?
- If the bananas are large add an extra egg.
- Play around with the spices and flavorings
