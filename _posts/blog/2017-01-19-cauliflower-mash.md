Cauliflower mash is becoming one of my favorite side dishes. Very easy to prepare and versatile, it goes well with a number of dishes, specially [stews](http://weekendfamily.github.io/foodforthepeople/blog/easy-chicken-stew/). This version is more evolved, with the spring onion and bacon making it almost a main course on it's own, but remove that and you are left with an incredible, and healthy, complement to most meals.

### Variations

- The spring onion and bacon are extras and not needed for the basic mash.
- If you don't have creme fraiche at hand any heavy cream will do. I have used greek yogurt in a pinch.
- You can also add a dollop of butter.

[This](http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/2012/01/better-than-potatoes-cheesy-cauliflower.html) is a good, creamy cauliflower recipe, and the idea for the bacon from someplace whose link I cannot find.

#### Ingredients

* Cauliflower: 2 heads, cut into florets
* Creme fraiche: 150g
* Parmigiano: 50 g, grated
* Garlic: 1 clove, minced
* Spring onion: 1 bunch, thinly sliced
* Bacon cubes: 150 g
* Salt and pepper: to taste
* Nutmeg: to taste


#### Directions

1. Boil the cauliflower florets for about 15 minutes or until soft in water with a little salt.
2. While the cauliflower cooks, gently fry the bacon in a frying pan at medium heat for about 5 minutes. It should not need any fat other than it's own. Add the spring onion and fry until cooked (about 5 minutes). Reserve.
3. Once the cauliflower is cooked, strain it removing as much water as possible. This is critical as otherwise the mash will be a little runny.
3. Add the creme fraiche and cheese, season with salt, pepper and the nutmeg, and blend it all together.
4. Serve with a topping of the bacon and spring onion.  
3. Enjoy!
