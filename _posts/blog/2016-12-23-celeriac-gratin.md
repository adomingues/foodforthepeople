This blog has been lacking something. New recipes for one. But also something fancy and something that I have not yet done, but will do this Christmas. So if you prepared it before the 25th you are on your own. Also no picture.

And this recipe? Well, I am big fan of celeriac as a side dish and anything will cheese, namely _gratins_ will make me heart warm. So when I saw the filling for [this recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/12/vegetarian-christmas-lunch-anna-jones-modern-cook) in The Guardian [of Manchester] I immediately saw an opportunity to impress my in-laws. More on that later.

3. Add the honey, most of the rosemary and thyme (save a little, with the sage) and salt. Cook on medium heat for another 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated. The the garlic cloves should be coated in a dark syrup.

4. While the sauce is thickening, peel the celeriac and cut it into quarters, setting aside about 13. Slice the rest in 2cm-thick pieces. Boil these pieces in hot water for 7-10 minutes. Drain. Meantime, grate the remaining celeriac.

5. In bowl mix the boiled celeriac, cheese, creme fraiche, lemon juice, mustard, parsley and eggs. Add salt and grind of pepper and gently fold in the caramelized garlic cloves.

6. Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Coat lightly an over form with olive oil, and then add the mix, grated celeriac, rosemary, thyme, all the sage, and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for 45 minutes or until it has set and the top is golden brown.
