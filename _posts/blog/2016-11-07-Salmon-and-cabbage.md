I must confess: I love cabbage. It goes well with any number of dishes, nutritious, has a wonderful green color, and comes in many variates. I am still skeptikal about green smoothies, and have profound dislike for the current Kale love. My forefathers grew [Repolho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repolho) before any hipster donned its first cap! 

Cabbage is a serious matter for me. Anyway, I got hold of this recipe and though it was a interesting combination of salmon and Vegetable king, and the Dill vinagrette intrigued me.

Who am I kidding? I wanted a cabbage dish and there was not a lot of time to prepare it. This fitted the bill. It also turned out to have a wonderful flavor with the dill and lemon combining well with the cabbage. 


### Variations

- I have a Kumquat tree which happens to have fruits at the moment. I took a Kumquat and squeezed the juice on top of the salmon before sticking it in the oven for extra citrus flavor.
- The recipe states Dijon mustard, and I kept because it sounds fancy. In fact, I used the rest of an old Bautzen mustard jar.
- The original recipe had 2 types of cabbage, Kale and Savoy. The hipsters took all the Grühnkohl from the supermaket. No problem. It worked nicely with just the Savoy and it sounds frencher.

This Martha Stewart [book](https://www.amazon.com/Low-Diet-Cookbook-Smart-Carb-Recipes/dp/156924359X) on our shelve for while and even though we made a few recipes, it seems underused. This recipe came from there and it was a hit, so hopefully there will be more to come.
