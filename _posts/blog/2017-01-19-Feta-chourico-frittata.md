Frittatas. Omelets for the middle class. What I love about them as that the basic ingredients are usually in the house - eggs - and then one throw what it whatever is lying around the pantry/fridge. It can even be used to re-purpose left-overs. Adding veggies to it also makes it a very nourishing and nutritious meal. It is also easy to put together and is one of my go to recipes when I run out of ideas.

This recipe has Feta and chouriço, which are two of my favorite ingredients. Both very versatile and full of flavor and thus very little extra seasoning is needed. But don't be bound to these ingredients. See variations for more ideas.

I happen to be lucky enough to have flameproof roasting tin, which means that I can make the dish in one pot. However, I have previously prepared the frittata in a frying pan, or pot, and after mixing with the egg, transfered everything to a roasting tin and into the oven. No problem. Ah, yes, I have a kitchen aid thingy also know as [MUM](http://www.bosch-home.co.uk/products/food-preparation/accessories-for-kitchen-machines.html) which turns the preparation of vegetables in to a child's play. Before I used a Juliane peeler. 


### Variations

- With minced meat, fried with the onion, and chilies
- Pumpkin, Feta and sage.
- Mushrooms. Very careful that it doesn't get too soggy.
- Butter will also do instead of the olive oil.
- I like to add cream to the adds to bulk it up, but you can leave it out.

Here and there. I took a basic [zucchini frittata recipe](http://breakingmuscle.com/fuel/paleo-zucchini-frittata-recipe) and have been making variations of it for while now.
