This is one my go to dishes when the winter comes. Filling, healthy and made with ingredients that are usually laying around, it makes for great comfort food. Even though this dish is fairly common in Portugal, I had for the first time in England with some friends. I think it might be more of a Southern dish. Anyway, it was love at first site and since them I have done it quite often. 


#### Variations

- In the absence of bacon I have used lard instead of olive oil for that nice pork flavor. 
- Some [Piri-Piri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_piri#Piri_piri_sauce) is a wellcome addition for those that like it hot. 
- If chouriço is not available, then consider adding sweet paprika. Not quite the same though.
- Instead of white wine, beer will do. Something dry like lager or Pilsner.

#### Inspiration

I followed the recipe from this [Portuguese website](http://lifestyle.sapo.pt/sabores/receitas/ervilhas-estufadas-com-ovos-escalfados), which is one of may regular sources of inspiration.

#### Directions

1. Take the peas out of the freezer.

2. In medium heat, gently fry the onion and garlic with the olive oil in a pot. When its fragrant, add the chouriço and the bacon and fry it until it gains come color.

3. Add the tomatoes, mix it all together, and cook for 5 minutes. Then add the wine and as soon as it starts boiling, the stock. Let it cook for another 5 minutes. At this point, season with salt if needed. 

4. Stir in the peas (even if they are still a little frozen), and add water until they are covered. Lower, the heat, put a lid on, and let it cook for 15 minutes or until it is cooked.

5. Taste the sauce and the peas to adjust the seasoning and check if peaks are cooked. If so, carefully break the eggs one by one and let them slide to the stew. You can make little pockets in the peas before this, so that the eggs are fairly separated from each other. Let it cook for another 5 minutes and it's done. 

6. Enjoy!
