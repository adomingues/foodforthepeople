#### Variations


#### Inspiration

The inspiring recipe can be found [here (Portuguese)](https://www.joseavillez.pt/jdownloads/Receitas/Receitas_S1/receita_p2_15jun_lascas_bacalhau.pdf) and it is a creation of the [Chef José Avillez](https://www.joseavillez.pt). That said, the recipe has changed so much that is bares little resemblance with the original.

#### Ingredients

* Celeriac: 1, cubbed in 1 cm pieces
* Salmon fillet: 2
* Eggs: 2
* Lemon: 1, zest
* Orange: 1, juice and zest
* Thyme leaves, 1 tablespoon
* Olive oil: 3 tablespoons, extra to brush
* Garlic clove: 1, sliced
* Sea salt: to taste
* Black Pepper: to taste


#### Directions

1. Top the celeriac, peel it with a knife removing the rough bits, and cut into 1 cm cubes.
2. Put a casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once warm, add the celeriac cubes, thyme leaves and lemon zest. Add some salt, mix it all together, and turn the heat down to medium. Cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender. Mix it every know and then.
3. Preheat oven to 220ºc. Brush the Salmon fillets with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Pop in in the oven for about 15 minutes or until it starts tearing apart when you put a fork to it. Once done, flake it and put it aside.
4. Once the celeric is done (it's soft and slightly brown), remove it from the pan, add some olive oil if needed and sauté the spinach with the garlic in the same pan. As it wilts, add the salmon, orange juice and mix it all together at low eat.
5. Fry the eggs sunny side up. 
6. On a deep plate or bowl, layer the celeriac, the salmon spinach mix, and top it off with the egg.
7. Enjoy.
