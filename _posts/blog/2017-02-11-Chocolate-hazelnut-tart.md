Do you love chocolate? And I don't mean milk "chocolate", I mean the real, raw stuff. Uncensored, unsweetened cocoa.

If the answer to the above question was "where is it and when can I have it?" then this recipe is for you. This is also one for those that don't like evolved and complex dessert/cake recipes. It is doesn't even require baking.

Has can be seen from the picture, it goes very well as little something for your coffee.

### Variations

- You can use small muffin forms instead of a large one.
- Vanilla extract can also be vanilla sugar or flavoring.

#### Ingredients

_Crust_

* Hazelnut flour: 90 grams
* Raw cocoa powder: 2 teaspoons 
* Coconut oil, melted: 3 tablespoons
* Maple syrup: 1 tablespoons
* Sea salt: a small pinch


_Filling_

* Coconut oil: 3 tablespoons
* Full-fat coconut milk: 3 tablespoons
* Maple syrup: 3 tablespoons
* Cocoa powder (I use half Natural, half Black Onyx): 6 tablespoons
* Vanilla extract: 1/2 teaspoon


#### Directions

1. Mix all the ingredients for the crust in a bowl using a flat spoon or fork. Line a ~16 cm cake form with it. I did it in ceramic form, but a silicon form might make it easier to remove the cake.
2. For the filling heat melt the Coconut milk, Coconut oil, and maple syrup in a sauce pan.  Swirl occasionally and turn up the heat if it is taking too lomg for the coconut oil to mix (don't let it boil). Once the mix is smooth, take from the heat and stir the cocoa powder and mix until smooth. Finally add the vanilla extract, and pour into the crust.
3. Store in the fridge for at least one hour before eating. Sprinkle each portion with shredded coconut for prettiness.
4. Enjoy!
