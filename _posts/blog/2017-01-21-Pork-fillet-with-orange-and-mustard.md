Not much to say about this dish except that it was very easy to prepare and tasted very nice indeed. The orange as a side (with some salad) is a [classic](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leit%C3%A3o_assado_%C3%A0_Bairrada) from my neck of the woods, though it is usually served with fatty pork meat. This is the opposite, since it is very lean meat - it is a fillet after all - but still works great. The sauce was perfect, but the meat could have stayed longer in the marinade. I let it marinate for 2-3 hours and it could have been there for double that time.

All in all, another one of those dishes that require very little effort, and can prepared in advanced. It does need some time to marinate, so not something to do on a whim after coming home from work.


### Variations

- Serve with a green leaves salad.
- Marinate longer - at least 4-6 hours.

Inspiration from a recipe published in a magazine of a large Portuguese supermarket chain, Continente. If you can read Portuguese, the [sister website](https://chef.continente.pt/) has plenty of good recipes with a very good search function.
