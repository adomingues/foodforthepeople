### Food
We all love food... we'll I do, and luckily for you I also like to share recipes.

### Cooking ~ Science ~ Coding
Cooking, like science and coding involves several iterations, failed experiments, and "this could be improved". So this is the place will I will put mine modifications to recipes, so that other can use. This being GitHub, it also means that others can see what went wrong, that the recipe, and improve it. 

<!-- ### Creating pages manually
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
It will be mostly done by me, @adomingues, with the help of my partner in crime, AF, which does not have a GitHub account. Yet.
